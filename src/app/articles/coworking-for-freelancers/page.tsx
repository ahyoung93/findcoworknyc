              <strong>Working from home sounds perfect until you're on day 47 of not changing out of sweatpants.</strong> The novelty wears off fast.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Coffee shops seem like the obvious alternative, but try taking a client call while someone's toddler has a meltdown two tables over. Or worse, when the barista passive-aggressively asks if you're "going to order anything else" after you've been there for four hours nursing a single latte.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              That's where coworking comes in. You get actual professional workspace without signing a 5-year lease. Most importantly: <strong>month-to-month flexibility.</strong> Revenue drops one month? Cancel. Land a big project and need daily workspace? Upgrade. It's the anti-commitment commitment.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">If You're Freelancing Part-Time</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Maybe you work from home 3-4 days a week and only need to escape occasionally. Day passes are your move. Here are the cheapest options:
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>The Farm SoHo ($18-29/day)</strong> is the best value in the city. It's got that rustic, slightly DIY creative vibe. Attracts designers and artists who can't justify WeWork prices. The coffee's decent and the WiFi works. At $18, you really can't complain.
            </p>

              className="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg my-6"
            />

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Cubico (from $20/hour)</strong> does hourly pricing, which is unusual. Perfect for quick half-day sessions or client meetings. Pet-friendly with four SoHo/NoLita locations.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork ($29-39/day)</strong> has 74+ NYC locations. You're never far from one. Good for networking — lots of other freelancers and startups around. Beer on tap if that's your thing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">If You're Freelancing Full-Time</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Once you're working from coworking spaces 2-3+ days a week, monthly memberships beat day passes on cost. Here's what actually makes sense:
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Spaces (from $119/month)</strong> has the cheapest hot desks in the city. It's bare-bones but functional. Locations in Fort Greene, Hudson Yards, and Park Ave. If you're watching every dollar, this is your spot.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>The Farm SoHo ($179/month)</strong> gives you a SoHo address for less than $200. Creative community, event space, meeting rooms. Good for designers and writers who like the artsy vibe.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork ($200-300/month)</strong> costs more but you get access to all 74 NYC locations. The networking events are actually useful — people do find clients there. If you're trying to grow your freelance business, the extra cost might pay for itself.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Green Desk ($250/month)</strong> is the best value in Brooklyn and Queens. Eight outer-borough locations. If you live in Brooklyn, why commute to Manhattan for coworking?
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Things Nobody Tells You About Choosing a Space</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Calculate your real costs, not just the membership price.</strong> That cheap space with a 60-minute commute costs more in time than a pricier nearby option. Factor in lunch and coffee too — Midtown lunch averages $15-25/day. And check if meeting rooms are included or if they're $8-50/hour extra. Printing costs can sneak up on you if you're not careful.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Never commit to a monthly membership without testing the space first.</strong> Buy day passes at 3-5 locations. Test the WiFi speed during your actual working hours — it might be fast at 8am but terrible at 2pm when everyone's there. Check noise levels. Try making a client call in their phone booths. Talk to current members and ask what they wish they knew before joining.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>If you meet clients regularly, location matters more than price.</strong> A central location makes it easy for clients to reach you. Professional spaces like Industrious or Serendipity Labs actually impress clients. Make sure the space includes meeting room hours or at least has rooms available when you need them. And yeah, good coffee matters — client impressions are formed in the first 30 seconds.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Use coworking for networking, not just workspace.</strong> WeWork and WorkHouse NYC run weekly networking events where people actually find clients. Nomadworks is community-focused with collaborative projects that turn into paid work. The Yard has creative community events and informal networking that feels less forced. Attend at least one event per month. Your next client or collaboration could come from a random coffee machine conversation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What Actually Works for Freelancers</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Sarah, a freelance designer, started with day passes at The Farm SoHo when she had client meetings. After three months, she upgraded to a hot desk at $179/month. "Best decision ever," she says. The creative community led to three major client referrals that more than paid for the membership.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Michael, a freelance marketing consultant, thought WeWork's $200/month hot desk was expensive. Then he found two ongoing clients through their networking events. It paid for itself in the first month. Now he tells other freelancers to stop thinking of coworking as an expense — it's a business development tool.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              David, a freelance developer living in Queens, picked Green Desk's Long Island City location. $250/month, 15-minute commute, and he avoids Manhattan prices entirely. "Why would I spend an hour commuting to pay more?" he asks. Fair point.
