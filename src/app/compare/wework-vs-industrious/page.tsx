              <strong>Everyone asks this question when they're shopping for coworking in NYC.</strong> WeWork has 74+ locations and costs less. Industrious has 25+ locations and costs more. So which one is actually better?
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Neither. They're optimized for completely different people. WeWork is the social, community-focused option with beer on tap and networking events every week. Industrious is the quiet, professional option with reception services and a boutique hotel vibe. Picking between them depends on what you actually need from a workspace.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Go with WeWork if:</strong> You're a startup founder, freelancer, or anyone who values community and networking. You want location flexibility (access to 74+ spaces globally). Budget matters — you're watching expenses and want transparent pricing. Day passes ($29-39) let you try before committing. The social atmosphere doesn't bother you; maybe you even like it.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Go with Industrious if:</strong> You need a consistently quiet environment for focused work. Client impressions matter — you're bringing people to the space. You're an established business or executive who values hospitality-level service. Reception services, mail handling, and guest management add real value. Premium amenities justify the higher price tag. You'd rather have fewer, higher-quality locations than maximum flexibility.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Numbers</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork has 74+ locations in NYC alone.</strong> Industrious has 25+. That's not a small difference — it's the difference between "there's definitely one near me" and "I should check if there's one in my neighborhood." WeWork's network is global too. Your membership works in any WeWork worldwide, which is huge if you travel.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Pricing is where it gets interesting.</strong> WeWork publishes their rates: day passes run $29-39, hot desks $200-300/month. Industrious makes you contact them for pricing, which universally means "more expensive." WeWork is transparent about being the mid-range option. Industrious is explicitly premium.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Both give you 24/7 access and phone booths. Both have solid WiFi and meeting rooms. But the differences show up in the details. WeWork has beer on tap and kombucha. Industrious has premium coffee and espresso machines. WeWork runs weekly community events — yoga, happy hours, pitch nights. Industrious keeps it quiet with occasional member events. WeWork is self-service with a community team around. Industrious has full reception services with staff who greet you by name.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>The vibe is completely different.</strong> WeWork spaces buzz with energy. Open layouts, startup founders, freelancers networking at the coffee machine. It can get loud — bring headphones. Industrious feels like a boutique hotel. Quiet, professional, almost library-like. People work there; they don't socialize there.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Who Actually Uses These Spaces</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork attracts startup founders, freelancers, and remote workers.</strong> You'll see early-stage teams pitching in conference rooms, designers with their MacBooks, digital nomads using day passes. Creative professionals — designers, writers, marketers. Remote employees from larger companies who need workspace a few days a week. Everyone's there for the community as much as the desk.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Sarah, a marketing consultant, says it plainly: "The community aspect is huge. I've found clients, hired team members, and made friends through WeWork events." That's the appeal. You're not just renting a desk; you're joining a network.
            </p>

              className="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg my-6"
            />

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Industrious attracts established businesses and executives.</strong> Financial services firms, consulting companies, law offices, medical practices. Teams of 5-50 people who need private offices and professional polish. Senior professionals who can't afford distractions. Anyone client-facing who brings people to the space and needs to make an impression.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Michael, a financial advisor, puts it differently: "When I need to focus or take client calls, Industrious is perfect. No distractions, just professional workspace." That's the value proposition. You're paying for quiet and hospitality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What You Need to Know About Each</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork's location advantage is massive.</strong> In Midtown alone, there are multiple WeWorks within walking distance. SoHo, Financial District, same story. If one space is full or you don't like the vibe, there's another one two blocks away. Your membership works globally — London, San Francisco, Tokyo. If you travel for work, this flexibility is huge.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Industrious takes the opposite approach:</strong> fewer locations, but every one is premium. Rockefeller Center, Union Square, prime SoHo. They're curated, less crowded, more exclusive. You won't find 10 Industrious locations in Midtown. You'll find one or two that are exceptionally nice.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>On pricing, WeWork wins on transparency.</strong> $29-39 day passes mean you can test it before committing. Hot desks at $200-300/month are straightforward to budget. Meeting rooms run $8-10/hour. You know what you're paying. Good for freelancers and startups watching expenses. Bad if you want to feel exclusive.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Industrious doesn't publish prices.</strong> You contact them for quotes, which means "expensive but we'd rather not say." You're paying for hospitality, quiet, professionalism. Worth it if you're an established business impressing clients. Not worth it if you're a freelancer who just needs a desk and WiFi.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Coffee quality differs more than you'd think.</strong> WeWork has standard drip coffee and cold brew. Gets the job done; nobody's writing home about it. Industrious has premium beans, espresso machines, specialty drinks. If you care about coffee, this matters. If you're chugging caffeine to stay awake, it doesn't.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>WeWork has beer on tap.</strong> Industrious doesn't. That tells you everything about the vibe difference. WeWork wants you socializing at 4pm with a beer in hand. Industrious wants you working productively in silence. Neither is wrong; they're just optimized for different people.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Questions People Actually Ask</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Can I switch between locations?</strong> At WeWork, yes — most memberships include access to any WeWork globally. Huge if you travel or want flexibility. At Industrious, access is typically limited to your home location. Some memberships include network access for an extra fee, but it's not the default.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Which has better meeting rooms?</strong> WeWork has more availability due to sheer numbers. Rooms are modern but book up quickly during peak hours. Industrious has higher-end finishes and furnishings — better for impressive client meetings. Usually easier to book last-minute because there are fewer members competing for rooms.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>What about internet speed?</strong> Both offer enterprise-grade WiFi. WeWork can experience slowdowns during peak hours in busy Midtown locations — too many people on the network. Industrious tends to be more consistent because fewer members per space. Both have backup connections and wired ethernet if you ask.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Which is better for teams?</strong> WeWork is better for startups and growing teams that need flexibility to scale up or down monthly. Industrious is better for established teams that need privacy, professional image, and don't expect frequent size changes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Actual Bottom Line</h2>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Neither WeWork nor Industrious is objectively "better." They serve different needs. If you value community, networking, flexibility, and affordability — WeWork. If you need quiet, professionalism, and hospitality-level service — Industrious.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Here's what smart people do:</strong> Use WeWork's day pass ($29-39) to test their vibe for a day. Then contact Industrious for a tour. The right choice becomes obvious once you've experienced each space firsthand. Don't overthink it; just go visit both.</p>
