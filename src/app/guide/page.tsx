              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Coworking means sharing workspace with professionals from different companies.</strong> In NYC, it's evolved far beyond basic shared desks.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today's coworking spaces offer **premium amenities, private offices, meeting rooms, and vibrant professional communities.** Think high-speed WiFi, coffee bars, phone booths, and networking events â€” all included.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>NYC has over 400 coworking locations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.</strong> Prices start at just $179/month for hot desks, scaling up to luxury spaces with gyms and wellness studios. Whether you're a freelancer, startup founder, or remote worker, there's a space that fits your needs and budget.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Why Choose Coworking in NYC?</h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. Networking Opportunities</h3>
                  <p>
                    NYC coworking spaces bring together professionals from diverse industries. You might find yourself working alongside
                    tech entrepreneurs in Midtown, creative agencies in Williamsburg, or finance professionals in the Financial District.
                    This diversity creates unique networking opportunities and potential collaborations.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Cost-Effective Alternative to Traditional Offices</h3>
                  <p>
                    Traditional office space in Manhattan can cost $50-150 per square foot annually. Coworking spaces offer a more
                    affordable alternative with flexible terms. A dedicated desk typically costs $400-800/month, while private offices
                    for small teams start around $1,500/month - significantly less than leasing traditional office space.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Flexibility</h3>
                  <p>
                    Unlike traditional leases that require 3-5 year commitments, most coworking spaces offer month-to-month memberships.
                    This flexibility is crucial for startups, freelancers, and companies testing the NYC market. Need to scale up or down?
                    No problem.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">4. Premium Amenities Included</h3>
                  <p>
                    Most NYC coworking spaces include high-speed WiFi, printing services, coffee and refreshments, phone booths,
                    and meeting rooms. Many also offer perks like beer on tap, wellness studios, pet-friendly policies, and
                    networking events - amenities that would be expensive to provide in a traditional office.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">5. Prime Locations</h3>
                  <p>
                    Coworking spaces are located in NYC's most desirable neighborhoods, from Midtown Manhattan to trendy Williamsburg.
                    This gives you a prestigious business address and easy access to clients, partners, and the city's vibrant culture.

                  <p className="mb-2">
                    A hot desk membership gives you access to any available desk in the common area on a first-come, first-served basis.
                    You don't have a dedicated spot, but you can work anywhere in the space. This is the most affordable monthly option,
                    with spaces like Spaces offering hot desks from $119/month and WeWork ranging from $200-300/month.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">How to Choose the Right Coworking Space</h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Location, Location, Location</h3>
                  <p>
                    Consider your commute and proximity to clients. Midtown Manhattan offers the most options (WeWork alone has 74+
                    locations), but Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and DUMBO have thriving coworking scenes with a more
                    creative vibe. Queens options in Long Island City and Astoria provide good value with shorter commutes for
                    outer-borough residents.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Budget and Value</h3>
                  <p>
                    NYC coworking ranges from budget-friendly ($119-200/month for hot desks) to premium ($1,500+/month for private
                    offices). Consider what's included: Does the price cover meeting room hours? Are events and coffee included?
                    Some spaces charge extra for printing or guest access. Calculate your total monthly cost, not just the base membership.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Vibe and Community</h3>
                  <p>
                    Different spaces attract different crowds. WeWork is corporate-friendly and great for networking across industries.
                    The Yard and Nomadworks attract creatives and startups. Industrious and Convene cater to established businesses
                    seeking premium, quiet environments. WorkHouse NYC focuses specifically on founders and entrepreneurs. Visit spaces
                    during your intended working hours to get a feel for the energy and noise level.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Essential Amenities</h3>
                  <p>
                    Make a list of must-haves versus nice-to-haves. Need 24/7 access for late-night work sessions? WeWork, Industrious,
                    and Jay Suites offer round-the-clock entry. Have a dog? Bond Collective and Cubico are pet-friendly. Need shower
                    facilities for bike commuters? Bond Collective has you covered. Premium coffee included at most spaces, but some
                    like Nomadworks and Industrious emphasize high-quality coffee programs.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Test Before Committing</h3>
                  <p>
                    Most spaces offer day passes or free tours. Visit 3-5 locations that fit your criteria. Work there for a full day
                    to test the WiFi speed, noise levels, desk comfort, and overall vibe. Chat with current members about their experience.
                    Many coworking spaces offer first-month discounts or trial periods - use these to ensure the space meets your needs.
